# Color Modem

A little projects that replicates effects of the main analog TV color standards
(NTSC, PAL, SECAM) in software. Written mostly to educate myself on how these
standards work, and on modulations and filters.

The code is messy, unoptimal, and bad in general. There is no real CLI, either.
You'll most likely need to make ad-hoc modifications to the `color_modem/cli.py`
file to make this code do anything useful. Or call the functions directly from a
Python REPL.
